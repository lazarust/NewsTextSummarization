# News Text Summarization


## Proof of Concept (Milestone 1)
I completed the proof of concept in a Kaggle notebook that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaslazarus/summarization-comparison). I ran a article summarization using the T5, BERT, GPT, DistilBERT, and GPT2. I should probably look at a concrete way to define correct summarizations to better choose the model to use. I also want to be able to user the pegasus-reddit_tifu model, because I feel like it would preform well.
